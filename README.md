Develop a demo app called pin your address on the map, to integrate Huawei map kit and location kit:
1)	When open the app, the app locates user’s current location and shows Huawei map.
2)	Mark user’s current location on the map with Star and popup user’s current address when click the Star. (Address description, not the Geocoding value)
3)	Display a pin on the map. User can move and click on the map, the pin will move to the point as user clicks. Popup the address description when user pins a point on the map.
